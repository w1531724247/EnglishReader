        <p id="contents" tabindex="0" role="main"><em>A</em> <em class="newTerm">class</em> is a category for objects that share characteristics. AppleScript defines classes for common objects used in AppleScript scripts, such as aliases, Boolean values, integers, text, and so <span>on.</span></p>
        <p>Each object in a script is an instance of a specific class and has the same properties (including the <code>class</code> property), can contain the same kinds of elements, and supports the same kinds of operations and coercions as other objects of that type. Objects that are instances of AppleScript types can be used anywhere in a script—they don’t need to be within a <code>tell</code> block that specifies an application.</p>
        <p>Scriptable applications also define their own classes, such as windows and documents, which commonly contain properties and elements based on many of the basic AppleScript classes described in this chapter. Scripts obtain these objects in the context of the applications that define them. For more information on the class types applications typically support, see “Standard Classes” in Technical Note TN2106</p>
